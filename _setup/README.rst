INTRODUCTION
============

The setup tools are used to simplify the development and distribution of
python projects. The stuff found in this package has been collected over the
time and finally been separated into its own package. It's a neverending
task nevertheless...

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

You need python 2 (>= 2.2) or python 3.


INSTALLATION

DOCUMENTATION
