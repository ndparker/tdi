=================================
 Template Data Interface (|TDI|)
=================================

**TDI** (`/ʹtedɪ/ <http://m-w.com/dictionary/teddy>`_ [#]_) is a
markup templating system written in python with (optional but
recommended) speedup code written in C.

Unlike most templating systems |TDI| does not invent its own language to
provide functionality [#]_. Instead you simply mark the nodes you want to
manipulate within the template document. The template is parsed and the
marked nodes are presented to your python code, where they can be
modified in any way you want.

|TDI| is currently available for python2 versions only (starting with
python 2.7). Python 3 is not supported yet. The following
alternative implementations are supported:

- PyPy (2.0) (Python only)
- Jython (2.7) (Python only)

Working Example
---------------

The following code renders a calendar, i.e. days of a month specified by
the caller.

The code is intended to give you a good impression of how |TDI| looks
like and feels like. It also tries to present many of |TDI|'s features
at once. When you read the documentation, feel free to :doc:`pick it up
<examples>` and play around with it.

If you don't want to review the example now, :ref:`just skip it
<learnmore>`\.

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/layout.html

Python Code

Result

With some simple CSS applied the table might look like this:

`Kess <http://www.kess-net.de/>`_ held an introductory talk about |TDI| at
`PyCon DE 2011 <http://2011.de.pycon.org/2011/home/>`_, which is `available
on youtube <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49ERjKlpY10>`_ (German, about 30
minutes).


Rationale, Advocacy, Key Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is the short variant why you should consider reading on:

    |TDI| is pure, simple, :doc:`fast <benchmark>` and powerful.

And here's a bit more (for the long variant have a look at the
documentation_):

**Pure**

- Template and Logic are strictly separated. |TDI| is the bridge
  between template and rendering logic.
- There is no templating language at all, just your markup language
  (e.g. HTML) and python. (There's a markup language for plain text
  templates, though).
- |TDI| is non-intrusive - it blends in, both on template and
  python side.

**Simple**

- |TDI| has a steep learning curve. It's easy to learn and easy to
  master.
- Knowing about your programming language (Python) and knowing about
  your template language (like HTML) is entirely sufficient.
- You can even use your usual tools to document and validate your code
  (like pylint, epydoc or an HTML validator).
- |TDI| escapes your content automatically - you are safe by default.
- |TDI| comes as a stand-alone package. Don't worry about dependencies.

**Fast**

- Use |TDI| for rapid development. It's easy to parallelize the work on
  layout and logic. You can even use mock-ups as templates.
- |TDI| runs with :doc:`ludicrous speed <benchmark>`.
- Pre-rendering the less dynamic parts makes it even faster.

**Powerful**

- Semantically partition your code both on template and logic side using
  overlays and scopes.
- Partial rendering is supported (useful for dynamic web sites).
- Process your templates during loading time with parser filters.
- |TDI| is unicode aware and automatically emits the desired encoding.
- |TDI| is designed to be highly customizable and extendable. Nearly every
  component can be modified or replaced.


Development Status
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

|TDI| has proven its performance and stability in high load production
environments, which means, it *works* and it's *stable*. There are still
some kinks to solve and a few missing minor features to add until |TDI|
reaches version 1.0. So, development wise it's effectively a beta
release right now.

Last but not least I'd like to thank the author of `HTMLTemplate
<http://py-templates.sourceforge.net/>`_. At the time I started
experimenting with document tree based template systems, *HTMLTemplate*
was short-listed. However, it had a different license back then, which
was unacceptable for my purposes and also missing some features, so
|TDI| was grown in the first place.

.. [#] The pronunciation came up while discussing |TDI| at the breakfast
       table. Once our little daughter picked it up and asked for her
       "teddy...?". [#]_

.. [#] It *does* invent some markup, though. Especially for plain text
       templates, because they naturally do not provide their own markup
       system.

.. [#] Well, the joke is easier to understand, if you're speaking German
       at your breakfast table.
