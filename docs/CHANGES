Changes with version 0.9.9.9

 *) Started a formal unit test setup (ongoing)

 *) Deprecated tdi.util.*
    The code there had nothing to do with tdi per se and hence was removed from
    public API.

 *) Removed previously deprecated code.

 *) Made lots of stylistic adjustments to satisfy pylint and flake8.

 *) Updated rJSmin to version 1.0.12

 *) Updated rCSSmin to version 1.0.6

 *) Removed support for Python < 2.7, PyPy < 2.0, Jython < 2.7


Changes with version 0.9.9.8

 *) Added C implementation of the PreRenderWrapper

 *) Fixed a few reference leaks

 *) Updated rCSSmin to version 1.0.4

 *) Updated rJSmin to version 1.0.9

 *) Added new tool collection: tdi.tools.template. It contains functions for
    automatic template discovery and ordering by inspecting overlay
    information (check out the "discover" function and the "Layout" class)

 *) WTF service: Added single-file loaders. (.html_file(), .xml_file() and
    .text_file()). These loaders integrate no filters, except the load filters.

 *) WTF service: Added DirectoryTemplateLister class. An instance of this class
    can be created by the global service's .lister() method.

 *) Added generic "WrappedTemplate" class

 *) Template: Added "force" argument to .reload() method

 *) AutoUpdate: Added reload callback registry and factory method for
    installing new template wrappers (.autoupdate_register_callback() and
    .autoupdate_factory())

 *) Fixed a few APIs of the AutoUpdate wrapper to not check for reload
    (.template(), .updated_available() and .reload())

 *) Explicitly pass encoding to prerender and overlay filter processing.
    This is mostly relevant for templates, which remove the encoding marker
    (text templates do that by default).

 *) Fixed the problem that overlay inspection didn't work together with
    overlay filters

 *) Explicitly ignore ModelMissingError exceptions in the prerender wrapper,
    when calling the user model adapter.

 *) Minor interface change: render methods and scopes can be explicitly set
    to None, which avoids triggering errors, if they are required.

 *) integration.wtf_service: added "require_scopes" and "require_methods"
    configurations

 *) Added option to model adapters to not silently ignore missing scopes

 *) integration.wtf_service: added "content_type" parameter to render
    functions. Explicitly passing "None" disables automatic content type
    setting.

 *) integration.wtf_service: added text template load/render functions

 *) node.render() now accepts "model" and "adapter" parameters, which allows
    subrendering using a different model.

 *) ModelAdapterInterface: got a new "new" method, to create the adapter with a
    different model.


Changes with version 0.9.9.7

 *) Removed some deprecated code and/or wrappers:
    tdi.template.FactoryCache, tdi.dtd.SoupDTD, tdi.dtd.TDIDTDWrapper,
    tdi.template.Loader, tdi.template.file_opener, tdi.template.Factory,
    tdi.template.OverlayFactory, tdi.template.html, tdi.util.decode_html,
    tdi.filters.HTMLCommentStripFilter, tdi.filters.HTMLWhiteSpaceStripFilter.

 *) The "-" node flag got a "+" counterpart. Depending on the template type
    one or the other may be useful. For example, text templates have a "-"
    set by default (specified by the template builder).

 *) TDI now provides 3 default template factories: tdi.html, tdi.xml and
    tdi.text. Since it's more complicated now to create those, it's
    recommended to adapt these factories to your needs by using their
    "replace" method.

 *) Added plain text markup (tdi.markup.text)

 *) Markup specific code moved into its own subpackage (tdi.markup):
    tdi.soup_parser, tdi.dtd, tdi.encoder, tdi.builder,
    tdi.filters.EncodingDetectFilter

 *) Attribute handling during rendering now respects the markup specific
    normalizer (case-sensitive for XML and text).

 *) ModelAdapterInterface: Added "emit_escaped" attribute. Prerender
    adapters should set that to a true value, render adapters to false.

 *) EncoderInterface: got a new "encode" method.

 *) TemplateNode: got a new "append_escape" method.

 *) EncoderInterface: got a new "escape" method.

 *) ListenerInterface: Must accept new "handle_escaped" events.

 *) EncoderInterface: "starttag" method's "closed" parameter is a bool now.

 *) ListenerInterface: "handle_starttag" got a new "closed" parameter. The
    self-closing slash (in HTML/XML) is not passed via the "attr" parameter
    anymore. This is mostly relevant, if you have written your own parser
    filters. Those need to be adjusted.

 *) TemplateNode: "append_node" accepts a "closed" parameter now. If true,
    the node must not receive an endtag.

 *) Node: Added a boolean read-only "closedelement" attribute.

 *) RawNode: now provides a "decoder" attribute (See DecoderInterface). So
    does the template tree root.

 *) DTDInterface: "normalize" and "closed" methods are gone.

 *) Factories (and builders) no longer accept a dtd query class, but a
    decoder class instead. Appropriate decoders can be found in the
    tdi.markup subpackage. They are also initialized with markup specific
    default filters.

 *) Implemented attribute analyzer in C.

 *) Implemented soup.markup.filters.EncodingDetectFilter in C.

 *) Implemented the BaseEventFilter in C, speeding up filter chain delegation
    for all filters inheriting from this class.

 *) Implemented the HTML entity decoder in C.

 *) Implemented the (X)HTML parser in C.

 *) The template factory now can be initialized with a default encoding.

 *) Added "cdata_containers" option to HTML minifier, in order to allow
    adding proper CDATA containers around embedded scripts and styles

 *) Exposed wtf.response.load_* functions via wtf_service.Middleware

 *) Fixed overwriting of the getlist method in
    wtf_service.RequestParameterAdapter.

 *) Added "comment_filter" option to HTML minifier, in order to allow
    conditional comment stripping.

 *) Improved scope documentation

 *) Removed <select> from HTML minifier's "block elements" list

 *) Removed Support for Python 2.3

 *) Added support for PyPy (Python only, 1.9, 2.0)

 *) Added support for Jython (Python only, 2.5, 2.7)

 *) Improved encoding handling for tdi.tools.javascript.SimpleJSON


Changes with version 0.9.9.6

 *) Added compat option to setup.py supporting the pip installer

 *) Fixed inconsistency between python and C regarding separator counters

 *) Added example for separator methods


Changes with version 0.9.9.5

 *) Raw nodes accept unicode now. It's automatically encoded using the
    document's charset. The EncoderInterface got a new method for that.

 *) Node objects grew a new method "render" for subrendering. Consequently,
    child nodes named "render" cannot be addressed anymore using the dotted
    notation.

 *) Improved HTML5 support:
    - Relax the parser to accept any nesting, except if it's actually forbidden
      by HTML5. The query classes SoupDTD and TDIDTDWrapper are deprecated in
      favor of HTMLDTD.

    - Encoding detector accepts <meta charset=xxx>

    - Ship with HTML5 named character entity mapping (generated from spec)

    - Extend HTMLForm tool with new methods for HTML5 input types (added a
      testpage for those types as well, see HTML Form Tools documentation).
      HTMLForm.multiselect is deprecated. Use HTMLform.select(multiple=True)
      instead.

 *) Deprecated some APIs, all of them emit a tdi.DeprecationWarning now
    instead of python's own, because the latter is ignored by default.

 *) Cleaned up tools and added some new ones (especially for html and
    javascript). The tools.escape module is completely deprecated.

 *) Various miscellaneous fixes and improvements

 *) Added tons of documentation. Added an example index.

 *) Added more tests. The test runner is now a separate script and distributed.


Changes with version 0.9.9.0

 *) First beta release
