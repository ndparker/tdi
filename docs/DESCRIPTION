 Template Data Interface (TDI)
===============================

TDI (Template Data Interface) is a markup templating system written in python
with optional speedup code written in C. Unlike most templating systems the
TDI does not invent its own language to provide functionality. Instead you
simply mark the nodes you want to manipulate within the template document. The
template is parsed and the marked nodes are presented to your python code,
where they can be modified in any way you want.
